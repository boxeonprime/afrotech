            <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS;
                IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.

            <div class="alert-info">
                <p>
                    These terms go over the details of donating to the the financing of AfroTok hereby names as "the Project". The details are such things like how money gets collected, whether
                    donations can be changed or canceled, and how donors can contact us to resolve issues relating to
                    charges. These terms are issued by Trevor Prime LLC, owner of AfroTok.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>These are the terms that apply when you’re backing the Project:
                You’re only charged immediately after submitting your payment information and once every month if you submit
                our donation form for recurring donations. The exact amount you donated is the amount Trevor Prime LLC
                will collect.</p>

            <p>In some cases we’ll reserve the charge on your card. Trevor Prime LLC and its payment providers may
                authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to
                the full donation.</p>

            <p>You can change or cancel your donation at any time before the project’s funding deadline (with one
                exception). You can increase, decrease, or cancel your donation at any time during the fundraising campaign.
                You can only increase, decrease, or cancel your donation by making special arrangements directly with Cage
                The Chameleon.</p>
            <p>The estimated delivery of the app is an estimate. The month and year listed on this website or elsewhere for
                the delivery of the app is an estimated delivery—not a guarantee to fulfill by that time. The schedule may
                change as Trevor Prime LLC works on the project.</p>
            <p>Trevor Prime LLC may need to send you questions about any reward offered. To deliver rewards, Cage The
                Chameleon might need information from you, like your mailing address or t-shirt size. We’ll request that
                information after the campaign has succeeded. To receive the reward, you’ll need to provide the information
                in a reasonable amount of time. Trevor Prime LLC will not ask for personal information that is not
                necessary to provide your reward, and will never request sensitive personal information such as your Social
                Security number or payment information. Contact us at support@CageTheChameleon.com if you receive a request
                for information that seems inappropriate or excessive.</p>


            <p>We'll help resolve payment-card disputes. If a backer of our project disputes the charge with their card
                issuer, we'll handle re-presenting the charge to settle the dispute with the card issuer. You’ll be notified
                that a dispute has been filed, and you’ll be able to provide evidence to help us resolve it in your favor.
            </p>

            <p>Your donation(s) to the Project does not constitute a guarantee that you'll be allowed to use the app in any
                shape or form.</p>
