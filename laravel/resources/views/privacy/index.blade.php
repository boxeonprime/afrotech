                that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you
                interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information".</p>

            <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>

            <ol>

                about how our visitors browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
                advertising campaigns).</p>
